# Learning Site Packages Folder Under OSX

## Today I was browsing couple Django extensions to check if there is any new useful stuff around. I saw couple questions in those WiKis/forums about site-packages folder under OSX.

For those who don't know which **site-packages** folder is active in your system, you must consider how your system is configured. Especially if you're using **HomeBrew** kinda tool and installed python that way, your default site-packages folder that is shipped with OS X might have changed.

Anyways, the best way to learn what's your active site-packages folder is to type following in the python **REPL**:

```python
from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib;
print get_python_lib()
```

Or you could just write following in the terminal:

```bash
python -m site --user-site
```
