# Migrating the Blog

## It's been a while I haven't written a single post. Couple days ago, I received some emails concerning my WordPress blog.

Turns out my hosting provider actually shut down any **WordPress** blogs they have due to some security concerns. This reminded me how insecure a simple blog engine could be even though they have **millions** of users. After some careful thinking, I decided to migrate my ex-blog to a staticaly generated new blog.

There are many alternative tools for **static site generation**. I personally evaluated couple of them; **Jeykll**, **Middleman**, **Docpad** to be more precise.. Honestly speaking they are all pretty powerful tools. However, I prefer simplicity over anything. So I went for *Docpad* for my blog.

You can find my blog source code on my **GitHub** account. Briefly, following are the plugins I've used for a tech heavy blog:

* CleanCSS
* CleanURLs
* Eco
* HighlightJS
* Less
* Marked
* Moment
* Partials
* Related
* Sitemap
* Uglify

You can shoot me an email or contact me through my **Twitter** handle if you have any more questions.
